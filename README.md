## Commit pattern

Commits should follow the [convention](https://conventionalcommits.org/).
We have the following types:

- feat: A new feature;
- fix: A bug fix;
- docs: Documentation only changes;
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc);
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature;
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing ones;
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation;
- perf: A code that improves performance;
- ci: Changes to the CI/CD process;
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm);
- temp: Temporary commits that won't be included in your CHANGELOG.

Example: `feat: add feature #issue_id`
